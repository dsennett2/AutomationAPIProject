We have created six different files:

AutomationAPI_ExtendedFeatureCollection.h

AutomationAPI_Widget.h

AutomationAPI_WidgetBuilder.h

ExtendedFeatureCollection.cpp

Widget.cpp

WidgetBuilder.cpp

All of these files are in the AutomationBinding library.

To look at the API reference generated with doxygen, run the index.html file inside of the html folder.

Our time esimates are located in the wiki section under estimates.
